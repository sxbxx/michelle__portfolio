                            <p>I joined Youth Aware as a product designer when it was just a small team.
                                We had three mobile developers and a product manager on board for the project.</p>

                            <p> They wanted to create two seperate mobile applications to help inform and educate the
                                public
                                about healthy eating and exercise.

                            </p>

                            <p>I led the product, marketing, UX and UI strategy for the team. I've been extremely
                                fortunate

                            <p> With the clock ticking, I quickly did some mockups of the basic user journey before
                                going over it with the desired styling. I opted for a refreshing gradient look and the
                                simplicity of the UI. I then created for the developers a clickable prototype in
                                Invision.</p>

                            <h6>Gamification Mobile Application</h6>
                            <p>As we went along with the project, the scope became larger, and the more unrealistic for
                                everything became to be completed on time. Instead of focusing on all two apps that I
                                have initially said, in the end, I just focused on making a gamification app since
                                creating the interface and assets for it has a higher priority. Additionally, we had
                                more ideas than we wanted to implement; however, we became short on time.</p>
                            <p>Also, due to the time limitations, I made some design choices to make a gender-neutral
                                character model make it easier to build assets on top of it, and it can be reused
                                between male/female character selections. Although I would of wanted to do more details
                                with the assets, I feel like I have done a decent job with it. </p>
                            <p>Since I dont really do much illustration work, there was a bit of problem solving and
                                experimentation of figuring out my own illustration style and is the most fitting for
                                the context of the client/project. Additionally I had to do some research and problem
                                solving on finding what is the best way of generating a large amount of assets in a easy
                                format. </p>

                            <p>Working in an early-stage startup was an extremely steep learning curve. It was an
                                eye-opening experience that taught me a lot about being lean and knowing when and where
                                to focus your energy and effort.‚Äç </p>
                            <p>Although the project still remains ongoing, I have learnt a lot while working within a
                                development enviroment It was an insightful experiance with everyone having dependence
                                on other people to work together on a common goal.</p>
